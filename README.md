# README

This app was created for a technical challenge. The task was to have a Rails JSON API with Angular front-end, and this was something I have not done previously.

This version used Webpacker version of Angular, which initially was the approach I have found to work. I came to regret doing it this way since, on top of having to figure out Angular on-the-fly, this approach required a lot of workarounds just to get the basic functionalities to work.

The project took me a week to implement and, unfortunately, there is not much to show for it. It did however help me understand Angular more and it paved the way for the next implementation of the project (see https://github.com/Sashfish/angchallenge2)
